            <h1>Reviews</h1>
            
            <h2>Hollowknight</h2>
            <p>Hollowknight is THE metroidvania. When it released it raised the bar to an unreachable height. Gameplay is as tight as it can get with super acurate controls and movement and combat teqnuiqes that are unlocked as you play. Music is filled with emotions and the artworks and animations are superb. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in metroidvanias or looking for a real challange. And it comes for a cheap price and all the content updates made for the game are free and included in any version of the game included. 10/10</p>

            <h2>Enter the gungeon</h2>
            <p>Enter the gungeon currently stands at the top of my favourite rouge-likes. It's just so fun and creative with a lot of stuff to do in it. It's challenging to the point of it being almost being sadistic but it always reafirms you that it's still not unfair. It is filled with cool and funny weapons, items and characters all with their own backstory and description. The challange comes from you being shoved into bullethell scenarios constantly as you have to kill your enemies and get to the next floor. Enter the gungeon has a lot going for it and it's worth playing if you are looking for a good challange with a bit of fun at every corner. 9/10</p>

            <h2>Dark souls 3</h2>
            <p>Dark souls 3, my favourite game from the souls series and among my top games of all time. I have dumped about 800 hours into this game and i still keep coming back to it all the time. The series has never seen better gameplay. It's fast, intense, tight and responsive and a lot more aggresive than previous souls games. It rewards experimentation as there is a variety of builds at your desposal. A bit more linear than it's predecessor but it makes it up in it's revitalised pvp system and crazy bosses. Some of the best bosses in the game but to get to the top tier you'll need the dlc's. The dlc's are filled with challanging bosses that will wreck your shit. This game is in my opinion the peak of the Dark souls series and i thoroughly recommend it. 9/10</p>

            <h2>Bloodborne</h2>
            <p>Bloodborne is up there with Dark souls 3 and it shares a lot of points with my ds3 review. The gameplay is similar but very different at the same time. With a new dodge and a gun as your secondary weapon, you are encouraged and rewarded by playing aggressive. The bosses are amazing but the basegames bosses sadly does get a bit easy for my taste. But in the dlc you get 3 masterfully crafted bosses that will put you skills to the ultimate test. 8.5/10</p>

            <h2>Sekrio shadows die twice</h2>
            <p>From the creators of Dark souls and bloodborne comes a game with a very different combat style. Going from a very open ended leveling system with a veriety of builds with a focus on dodging. To a game with only one weapon with subweapons that you can combo with. Making you learn each enemy and boss in and out and burning movesets dodgewindows and attackpatterns into your mind. It's challanging in just the way i like it. The world is well developed and looks bueatiful and fun to traverse. The story is simple but never in a bad way. It services the world and gameplay well. Sekiro is a fun challenging game that i recommend for people looking for a real challange. 9.5/10</p>

            <h2>Legend of Zelda Skyward sword</h2>
            <p>Skyward sword. The first game in the series i played, and also my favourite one. Very different from the rest of the series as it utilises motion controlls to controll Links sword. Something largely not liked by parts of the community but i love it. This is a game i recommend because of personal bias and an amazing story. Even though the game is a bit repetetive linear and you end up doing a lot of backtracking the way areas are used in multiple ways is something new and cool. Some bosses are repeated and there are only a few that stand out. But in my opinion that is everything that's needed. The cool bosses and characters in this game are just so well designed and unique. The game looks amazing and that bueaty is only matched by the series best sound design and music track. It is a review that is filled with personal bias but ill still so take that into consideration. 10/10</p>

            <h2>Undertale</h2>
            <p>Undertale is a fun and pretty calm game. A bullet hell but done in an odd but cool way. It starts out easy like every game and proggresevly gets harder as it goes on. It never gets to that ultimate challange unless you are looking for it. It's filled with godly music and bossfights, aswell as fun and snappy dialouge with interesting characters. It also touches on some deep subjects and questions the humanity of the player. It's a very unique game that will always be remembered. 8/10</p>

            <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
            <p>Stardew Valley. Just a fun game about being a farmer. A variety of things to do, take care of animals, grow crops, fish and mine in caverns. Plan ahead and explore. The town is filled with interesting characters and is filled with secrets to explore. This is just a game that is chill and warm to the core and you cant go wrong playing it. 8.5/10</p>

            <h2>League of legends</h2>
            <p>League is a game with good gameplay and visual design and is by definition a spectacular game. But that is not how it works when it comes to online videogames. The community is doghsit as it's filled with immature, angry and addicted people who won't play anything at all or doesn't play enough to be good. You can never count on your teammates. And riot isnt making it better by not taking care of the game and ignoring the playerbase. 6/10</p>

            <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
            <p>It's a gachagame cashgrab that doesnt do anything original. Dont play it. 4/10</p>
